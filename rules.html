                        <li>Personal attacks and harassment targeting players or staff will not be tolerated.</li>
                        <li>Sexist, racist, homophobic, and broad, offensive generalizations about groups of people are
                            simply not allowed.</li>
                        <li>Any word blocked by a filter is never allowed no matter how it's written, even if it gets
                            around the filter itself.</li>
                        <li>You can talk about current events and real-world topics. However, if staff recognizes the
                            topic is causing players to become uncomfortable, they may shut the conversation down.
                            <ul class="fullpagelist2">
                                <li>You are welcome to take conversations regarding sensitive topics to dm's and party
                                    chat with people who want to be involved, or off the server.</li>
                            </ul>
                        </li>
                        <li>Don't spam. This includes excessive use of chat, caps, player-related commands, or any other
                            medium.</li>
                        <li>Keep others in mind when talking in public chat. Personal and/or exclusive conversations are
                            often better suited for DMs or party chat. Staff may direct you there if they feel your
                            conversation is clogging chat.
                            <ul class="fullpagelist2">
                                <li>Since messages in global chat get sent to every server we want to avoid spam and
                                    unnecessary messages. If you send advertisements they cannot require a bid in
                                    response, all bidding needs to be done in a single server chat or through the
                                    Discord. Other conversation that can clog up the global chat should also be kept to
                                    a single server, you can have minor conversations in global chat but it should not
                                    become long or clog up the entire chat. We highly encourage the use of private
                                    messages or party chats if you want to have longer conversations across the
                                    different servers!</li>

                    <h2>Do Not Impersonate Staff</h2>
                    <p>Do not impersonate staff members or portray yourself as one when you are not. It is ok to share
                        the rules with others, but please do not try to force others to follow them - reach out to a
                        staff member if you need help.</p>
                    <p>Do not mini-mod. If a staff member is already helping a player please don't interfere. We
                        appreciate players trying to help out other players but if staff is already helping it can cause
                        confusion. You can remind players of the rules, but remember that you cannot enforce them or
                        punish players.</p>
                    <p>Do not make "official" MykalsMC products or events. If you make something related to MykalsMC
                        please make sure it's clear that it is not an official MykalsMC thing. We cannot moderate
                        unofficial things and cannot be responsible for what happens related to them!</p>
